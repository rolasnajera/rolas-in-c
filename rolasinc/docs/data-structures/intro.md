What are data structures
The way we organize the data, taking in consideration memory. 

List of the data structures:
Physical data structures (Defines arrangement)
- Arrays
- Matrices
- Linked list

Logical data structures (Defines utilization)
- Stack
- Queues
- Trees
- Graph
- Hashing

Why study data structures?
As a programmer you would need to choose

What level of study do we need?
- First level -> you know about the list of existant data structures, and how they work.
- Second level -> You are able to do analysis, to understand in depth, considering time and space complexity
- Third level -> You know how to code data structures

Important note:
Problem solving != Programming
Problem solving -> good at mathematics
Programming -> Syntaxis
Recursion is important to learn problem solving
